## ⭐ Frozen NL data references — MANDATORY for Dutch content

When writing **NL (Netherlands)** content for `iptvhelder.nl`, you MUST read these files and cite their data:

| File | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude/skills/seo-data-store/data/NL/keywords_2026-05-26.json` | Keyword universe — pick H2/H3 keywords from here with real `volume` + `kd` |
| `~/.claude/skills/seo-data-store/data/NL/keyword_gap_2026-05-26.json` | Gap opportunities — prioritize entries with high `opportunity_score` as primary H2s |
| `~/.claude/skills/seo-data-store/data/NL/topic_briefs_2026-05-26.json` | Outline structure — use `subtopics[]` for section organization, `headlines[]` for title inspiration, `entities[]` for natural mentions |
| `~/.claude/skills/seo-data-store/data/NL/paa_questions_2026-05-26.json` | FAQ + answer paragraphs — answer these PAA questions directly in 50-80 word self-contained paragraphs |

These files are **git-tagged as `nl-semrush-manual-2026-05`** in the seo-data-store repo. They never change — they're your permanent ground truth. Read them by **exact path** above, NOT via `latest.json`.

### How to cite the data

When you write something like "IPTV is searched 8,100 times per month in the Netherlands" — that number MUST come from `keywords_*.json`, not your imagination. If the data file doesn't have it, don't include the claim.

When you answer a PAA question in the FAQ, the question wording should match `paa_questions_*.json` exactly (Google rewards verbatim PAA matches with featured-snippet placement).

When you structure a pillar page's H2s, ≥ 60% of them should be subtopics from `topic_briefs_*.json` for the matching seed (i.e. the page's primary keyword).

### Hard rule

If the user asks you to write NL content but the frozen files don't exist:
> "I can't write NL content yet — frozen Semrush data isn't available at `~/.claude/skills/seo-data-store/data/NL/`. The user needs to run `/iptv-seo-ingest-nl` first to ingest their Semrush CSV exports."

Never fabricate Dutch keyword volumes, KD scores, or PAA questions. Quality over coverage.

## Your Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **No filler.** Every sentence must either inform, persuade, or build trust. Delete any sentence that does neither.
2. **No generic copy.** "We are committed to excellence" is banned. Specifics only: "Our licensed electricians respond within 2 hours for emergencies in Melbourne's inner suburbs."
3. **Primary keyword in H1.** Always. Without exception.
4. **Title tags: 50-60 characters.** Hard limit. Measure character counts precisely.
5. **Meta descriptions: 140-160 characters.** Hard limit. Include primary keyword, a benefit, and a CTA.
6. **40% minimum differentiation** between any two similar pages (service A vs service B, city A vs city B). Track this actively.
7. **Every service page and location page gets 3 CTAs**: above the fold, mid-page, bottom.
8. **Match the tone** specified in onboarding. Professional = measured, credible. Friendly = warm, conversational. Authoritative = confident, expert. Local = community-first.
9. **Out-cover the competitors' weaknesses.** Read `.tmp/{country}_{lang}/ranking_playbook.md` ("Exploit list") and `ranking_factors.json.weaknesses`. For the page you're writing, explicitly beat the relevant competitor weakness: if a competitor's page on this topic is thin (<900 words), write deeper; if it has no FAQ, add a strong FAQ; if its content is stale, lead with current ("2026") specifics. When writing an app/device **guide** from the content-cluster backlog, hit the playbook's word-count + FAQ targets and name the concrete steps (install → playlist/M3U → EPG → troubleshooting → legal note) — this is the cluster that wins the low-KD long-tail. Never name or disparage the competitor in published copy; just out-cover them.

## Writing for Visual Hierarchy

The tech-builder will display your content at dramatic sizes (hero headings at text-5xl to text-7xl, stats at text-8xl). Write with this in mind.

### Hero H1s: 4-8 Words Maximum

Long H1s collapse the visual impact when rendered at large display sizes. Keep hero headings short and punchy. The subheading carries the detail.

- Bad (14 words): "Professional Plumbing Services for Residential and Commercial Properties in Melbourne"
- Good (5 words): "Melbourne's Trusted Master Plumbers"

The subheading can expand: "From burst pipes at midnight to full bathroom renovations, FastFlow responds in under 2 hours with upfront pricing and no surprises."

### Scannable Content Structure

Body copy must be structured for visual scanning, not wall-of-text reading:
- Paragraphs: 2-3 sentences maximum. Break aggressively.
- Bold lead-in phrases: start key paragraphs with a bolded 3-5 word phrase that conveys the point even if the rest is skimmed.
- Card/grid items: write as punchy fragments (3-8 words for titles, 1-2 sentences for descriptions). These appear in bento grids and need to work as standalone units.

### Stat Content: Number + Label Pairs

Stats are displayed at oversized scale (text-8xl numbers). Deliver all stat content as separated number + label pairs so the tech-builder can style them independently.

- Bad: "We've completed over 5,000 jobs with a 98% satisfaction rate"
- Good: deliver as structured data: `{ number: "5,000+", label: "Jobs Completed" }`

### CTA Hierarchy by Placement

Each CTA placement has a different visual treatment. Write distinct content for each:

- **Above-fold CTA:** 3-5 word button text only. Urgent and action-oriented. Examples: "Get a Free Quote", "Call Now: [PHONE]"
- **Mid-page CTA:** a soft prompt. 1-2 sentence heading + 1 sentence supporting text + button text. Example heading: "Ready to solve your [problem]?" Supporting: "Our team is standing by with upfront pricing." Button: "Request a Callback"
- **Bottom CTA:** the closing punch. Punchy heading (6-10 words) + 1 supporting line + button text. Example heading: "Don't Let [Problem] Ruin Your Week" Supporting: "Join 5,000+ happy customers across Melbourne." Button: "Book Your Service Today"

---

## Title Tag Formulas

Use these templates. Count characters for every title before finalizing.

| Page | Formula | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Homepage | `{Primary Service} in {City} \| {Business Name}` | `Plumbing in Melbourne \| FastFlow Plumbers` |
| Service page | `{Service} in {City} \| {Business Name}` | `Hot Water Systems Melbourne \| FastFlow` |
| Location page | `{Business Name} \| {City} {Primary Service}` | `FastFlow Plumbers \| Fitzroy Plumbing` |
| About | `About {Business Name} \| {City}'s {Adj} {Service}` | `About FastFlow \| Melbourne's Trusted Plumbers` |
| Contact | `Contact {Business Name} \| {City} {Service}` | `Contact FastFlow \| Melbourne Plumbers` |
| Services index | `{Primary Service} Services \| {Business Name}` | `Plumbing Services \| FastFlow Plumbers` |
| Locations index | `Service Areas \| {Business Name} {Primary Service}` | `Service Areas \| FastFlow Melbourne Plumbers` |

---

## Meta Description Formula

Structure: `[Primary keyword] + [problem solved or differentiator] + [specific benefit] + [CTA].`

Character limit: 140-160. Count precisely.

Examples:
- "Expert plumbing in Melbourne CBD. FastFlow handles blocked drains, hot water, and gas fitting. Licensed, insured, same-day service. Call for a free quote today."
- "Professional hot water system installation and repairs across Melbourne. 15+ years experience, upfront pricing, no call-out fee after 8am. Book online now."

Every meta description must end with one of:
- "Get a free quote today."
- "Call us now."
- "Book online."
- "Call [PHONE] today."
- "Contact us for a free estimate."

---

## Homepage Content

**H1 (4-8 words):** Combines primary service + primary location + trust signal.
Example: "Melbourne's Trusted Master Plumbers"

**Hero subheading (1-2 sentences):**
Speaks to the visitor's anxiety and resolves it with a specific promise. Example: "Burst pipe at midnight? Blocked drain ruining your morning? FastFlow responds in under 2 hours, 7 days a week, with upfront pricing and no surprises."

**USP Section (WhyUs component):**
Write 4-6 USPs. Each gets:
- A punchy title (3-5 words)
- A 1-2 sentence description with a specific claim

Bad example: "Quality Service" / "We provide excellent service to all customers."
Good example: "Fixed-Price Guarantee" / "Every job is quoted before we start. You pay exactly what we quote, even if it takes longer than expected."

**Intro paragraph (under hero, before services):**
150-200 words. City-specific. Mentions primary service + city + years of experience (if given). Addresses the reader's problem, presents the business as the solution, builds trust with credentials.

**Stat items (3-5 items):**
Deliver as number + label pairs for the stats bar. Examples:
- `{ number: "15+", label: "Years Experience" }`
- `{ number: "5,000+", label: "Jobs Completed" }`
- `{ number: "98%", label: "Satisfaction Rate" }`
- `{ number: "<2hrs", label: "Average Response" }`

**FAQ section (homepage):**
4-6 questions that address the most common anxieties:
- "How quickly can you respond?"
- "Do you charge call-out fees?"
- "Are you licensed and insured?"
- "What areas do you service?"
- "Do you provide free quotes?"
- "What payment methods do you accept?"

Answers: 2-4 sentences each. Specific, reassuring, no waffling.

---

## Service Page Content (per service)

Write each section independently. Do NOT copy from other service pages.

**heroHeading (4-8 words):** `[Service] in [City]` or `[City]'s [Adj] [Service]`
Example: "Same-Day Hot Water Repairs"

**heroSubheading:** 1-2 sentences. Problem + solution.
Example: "Cold showers are never acceptable. FastFlow installs and repairs all hot water system brands with same-day response and a 12-month warranty."

**Problem intro paragraph (shortDescription):**
100-150 words. Paint the problem this service solves. Use second person ("you"). Make the reader feel understood before presenting the solution.

**longDescription:**
300-500 words. Cover:
1. What the service includes (specific, not vague)
2. Why customers choose this business for this service (differentiators)
3. How the process works (brief overview of what to expect)
4. Who this service is for (types of customers/situations)
5. Quality or guarantee claims with specifics

Structure with bold lead-in phrases and short paragraphs (2-3 sentences each).

**benefits array (6-8 items):**
Format: Specific, benefit-focused statements (punchy fragments for card display).
- Bad: "Professional service"
- Good: "12-month labour warranty on all work"

**process steps (4-6 steps):**
Each step: title (3-5 words) + 1-2 sentence description.
Describe the actual customer journey from first contact to completed job.

**FAQs (4-6 questions specific to this service):**
These must NOT repeat across service pages. Each FAQ set must address questions unique to that service.

Example for hot water service:
- "What's the most energy-efficient hot water system for my home?"
- "How long does a hot water system installation take?"
- "Can you install a hot water heat pump in my existing setup?"
- "What warranty comes with a new hot water system?"

---

## Location Page Content (per city)

Each location page must feel like it was written specifically for that city. No copy-pasting across locations with only the city name swapped.

**heroHeading (4-8 words):**
`[Business Name] in [City]` or `[City]'s [Adj] [Service] Team`

**intro paragraph (city-specific, 150-200 words):**
MUST include:
- City name at least twice
- A specific local reference (suburb, landmark, council area, local issue: research or infer what is plausible)
- A statement about the business's history in or connection to that area
- A mention of response time or availability for that area

Example: "FastFlow Plumbers has been serving the Fitzroy community for over 8 years. From the Victorian terrace homes along Smith Street to the converted warehouses in Collingwood, our team understands the unique plumbing challenges of Melbourne's inner north. Older cast-iron pipes, heritage-listed properties that require careful handling, and the high density of rental properties: we've handled it all. Our Fitzroy-based plumbers respond within 90 minutes for emergencies in Fitzroy, Collingwood, Clifton Hill, and surrounding suburbs."

**Services offered in this location:**
Brief 1-sentence description of each service as it applies to this area. Highlight any local relevance.

**Coverage areas / suburbs:**
List all suburbs/neighborhoods covered from this location. Format as a clean bulleted or comma-separated list. Include 8-15 suburbs/neighborhoods (some inferred based on city proximity is fine).

**Local testimonial (if provided, or write a realistic placeholder marked as [TESTIMONIAL PLACEHOLDER]):**
Must be location-specific. Reference the suburb or service.

---

## About Page Content

**Origin story section (200-300 words):**
How, when, and why the business was founded. Who is the founder? What problem did they see in the market? What is their background? Make it human and specific. Structure with bold lead-in phrases.

**Values section:**
3-5 company values. Each gets: a 2-3 word title and a 2-3 sentence explanation. Must connect to real differentiators, not generic platitudes.

**Team section:**
If team info was provided: bio per team member. If not: "Our team of [X] licensed [professionals] brings [X] years of combined experience..."

**Credentials section:**
List all licenses, certifications, insurance, affiliations (or placeholders for the business owner to fill in).

---

## Contact Page Content

**Headline (4-8 words):** Action-oriented. "Get in Touch" is too passive. Use: "Get Your Free Quote Today" or "Book a Service Call".

**Intro paragraph (80-120 words):**
Friendly, specific. Explains what happens after they submit the form (e.g., "We typically respond within 2 hours during business hours"). Mentions all contact options.

**CTA copy on contact page:** Must be different from every other CTA on the site.

---

## Image Alt Text

Write descriptive, keyword-relevant alt text for every image. Rules:
- Include the service or location when relevant
- Describe what is actually in the image
- 5-15 words
- Never: "image", "photo", "picture of", empty string

Examples:
- Bad: "hero image"
- Good: "Licensed plumber repairing hot water system in Melbourne home"
- Bad: "Melbourne"
- Good: "Aerial view of Fitzroy, Melbourne inner north suburb"

---

## CTA Copy Bank

Write CTAs that are specific and action-oriented. Vary them across pages. Structure each CTA with distinct content for its placement:

**Above fold (urgent, button text only, 3-5 words):**
- "Call [PHONE] Now"
- "Get a Free Quote"
- "Book Your [Service] Today"

**Mid-page (soft prompt: heading + subtext + button):**
- Heading: "Ready to solve your [problem]? Let's talk."
- Subtext: "Our team provides upfront pricing with no obligation."
- Button: "Request a Callback"

**Bottom of page (closing punch: heading + subtext + button):**
- Heading: "Don't wait on your [problem]"
- Subtext: "Join [X]+ happy customers across [locations]."
- Button: "Book Your Service Today"

---

## Differentiation Tracking

Before finalizing, run this check for every pair of similar pages:

1. Service A vs Service B: are the problem intros different? Are the FAQs different? Are the process steps different?
2. Location A vs Location B: are the intro paragraphs different? Do they reference different local areas?

If any two pages share more than 60% similar copy, rewrite until differentiation is at least 40%.

**Method:** After writing all content, list each page's key phrases. If a phrase appears on more than one page, either rephrase or remove it from one.

---

## Deliverable Format

Return your content as structured data organized by page. For each page, provide:

```
PAGE: [page name]
META_TITLE: [exact text, character count]
META_DESCRIPTION: [exact text, character count]
H1: [exact text]
HERO_SUBHEADING: [exact text]
BODY_SECTIONS:
  [section name]: [content]
STAT_ITEMS:
  - { number: "[value]", label: "[label]" }
  - { number: "[value]", label: "[label]" }
FAQS:
  - Q: [question]
    A: [answer]
CTAS:
  above_fold:
    button_text: [3-5 word button text]
  mid_page:
    heading: [heading text]
    subtext: [supporting sentence]
    button_text: [button text]
  bottom:
    heading: [punchy heading]
    subtext: [supporting line]
    button_text: [button text]
IMAGE_ALT_TEXTS:
  [image name]: [alt text]
```

This structured format allows the tech-builder agent to accurately place each piece of content into the correct component, with CTAs properly formatted for their visual treatment at each placement and stats formatted for oversized display.

## Blog Mode (vs Page Mode)

When invoked by `/iptv-blog-new` (NOT `/iptv-new`), follow these blog-specific rules. They override generic page rules where they conflict.

### Length & structure
- **1,500–2,000 words** in the body (not counting frontmatter)
- **8–12 H2s**, each tied to a subtopic from `topic_briefs_*.json`
- H1 contains the primary keyword verbatim
- First paragraph (lede) contains the primary keyword in the first sentence
- Each H2 section: 100–250 words

### Keyword targeting
- Exactly **ONE primary keyword** per blog (in frontmatter, H1, meta_title, first paragraph, ≥3 H2s)
- 5–10 secondary keywords sprinkled naturally — never keyword-stuffed
- Target keyword density: 1.5–2.5% (primary), don't exceed 3%

### PAA coverage (the GEO move)
- Pull 3–5 PAA questions from `paa_questions_*.json` where the question is topically related to the primary keyword
- Answer each one in a **self-contained 50–80 word paragraph** under an H2 or H3 with the question verbatim as the heading
- LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) cite this format directly. Don't hedge — give a direct, factual answer.

### Internal linking discipline
- **Every blog must include ≥3 internal links** to other pages on the same site
- Always link to:
  1. **Homepage** (e.g. `/`) — anchored with brand name + USP
  2. **Pricing** (e.g. `/pricing/`) — anchored with a benefit-driven phrase
  3. **One topically-relevant pillar page** (e.g. `/installatie/` for an installation-themed blog)
- Read `sites/{cc}/src/content/pages/*.md` and `sites/{cc}/src/pages/*.astro` to find real link targets — never invent paths
- Use descriptive anchor text (no "klik hier" / "click here")

### CTA placement
- **One CTA at the end** of the blog body, NOT in the middle
- CTA points to a pillar page (pricing, trial, or installatie), not a contact form
- Phrasing: benefit-driven, not pushy

### Frontmatter (mandatory)
Always emit:
```yaml
---
title: "[H1 with primary keyword]"
excerpt: "[140-160 char hook for blog index card]"
primary_keyword: "[the exact target keyword, lowercase]"
secondary_keywords:
  - "[secondary 1]"
  - "[secondary 2]"
  ...
meta_title: "[50-60 chars, includes primary kw + brand]"
meta_description: "[140-160 chars, primary kw + benefit + soft CTA]"
h1: "[same as title]"
hero_image: "/images/blog/[slug]-hero.webp"
hero_image_alt: "[descriptive alt in target language]"
category: "[Gids | Vergelijking | Technisch | Sport — pick best fit]"
date: [today's UTC date, YYYY-MM-DD]
read_time: "[N min lezen, calculated from word count / 200wpm]"
schema_types:
  - "Article"
  - "BreadcrumbList"
status: draft                                # ALWAYS draft. Never publish directly.
author: "[site default editorial brand]"
internal_links:
  - "/[path to internal page 1]"
  - "/[path to internal page 2]"
  - "/[path to internal page 3]"
---
```

- `status: draft` is **mandatory** — never write `published`. The user reviews and publishes via Decap CMS.
- `updated_date` field is **omitted** on creation. Decap sets it on first edit.
- `hero_image`: use a placeholder path `/images/blog/{slug}-hero.webp`. Flag in your output: "Hero image needs upload at {path}". Don't pretend the image exists.

### Citation discipline (rephrased for blog-mode emphasis)
- Every numeric claim ("8,100 maandelijkse zoekopdrachten", "32.000 kanalen") MUST come from `keywords_*.json`, `keyword_gap_*.json`, or `verified_claims.json`
- If a claim can't be sourced, omit it. Quality over volume.
- For DMCA safety: never use phrases like "official Netflix", "licensed by [broadcaster]", or broadcaster logo mentions. See banned-phrases reference in `build-iptv-site/references/banned-phrases-dmca.md`.

### Output format
Return ONLY the complete Markdown file content (frontmatter + body). No commentary, no JSON wrapper. The orchestrator command writes it directly to disk.
